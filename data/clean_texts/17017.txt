                                          Abstract: This study predicts the presence or absence of terrorism in Europe on a previously unex-
                                          plored spatial scale. Dependent variables consist of satellite imagery and socio-environmental data.
                                          Five machine learning models were evaluated over the following binary classification problem: the
                                          presence or absence of historical attacks within hexagonal-grid cells of 25 square kilometers. Four
                                          spatial statistics were conducted to assess the validity of the results and improve our inferential
                                          understanding of spatial processes among terror attacks. This analysis resulted in a Random Forest
                                          model that achieves 0.99 accuracy in predicting the presence or absence of terrorism at a spatial
                                          resolution of approximately 5 km. The results were validated by robust F1 and average precision
                                          scores of 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. Additionally, statistical analysis revealed spatial differences
                                          between separatists and all other terrorist types. This work concludes that remote sensing, machine
                                          learning, and spatial techniques are important and valuable methods for providing insight into
                                          terrorist activity and behavior.

                                       become increasingly attractive to future attackers [16], and a relationship between terror-
                                       ists’ bases of planning and preparation [17–19] suggests target locations are a function of
                                       geographic convenience as much as an act of coercion.
                                             Singh et al. combined Hidden Markov Chains to model, in real-time, activities deemed
                                       consistent with historical attacks and determine the best actions to prevent them [20].
                                       Additionally, Dixon et al. developed a feed-forward neural network (NN) to identify
                                       deceptive behavior, producing an average accuracy of 0.6 with the best success rate of
                                       0.68 [21]. An ensemble was also trained to predict the attributes of attacks with accuracy
                                       scores of 0.79 to 0.85 [22]. Mo et al. built a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes
                                       classifier, and a Logistic Regression to predict terrorist events with a maximum accuracy of
                                       0.78 [23].
                                             Dixon et al. [24] developed a NN, SVM, and a Random Forest, in which the authors
                                       concluded 0.96 accuracy scores and robust classification reports in predicting attack loca-
                                       tions, but noted the global aggregation reduced the model’s sensitivity to regional and
                                       local factors.
                                             Most recently, Uddin et al. [25] developed five machine learning models based on NNs
                                       to predict the outcomes of attacks, such as attack type and weapon used. To supplement
                                       NN architectures, the researchers employed logistic regression, SVM, and Naïve Bayes
                                       classification. A comparison of results concluded that DNNs are more successful than other
                                       algorithms, achieving 0.95 accuracies compared to 0.83 for non-DNN models. In doing so,
                                       the team concluded the successful creation of a model that accurately predicts the future
                                       lethality of a terror organization based solely on the first 10 attacks attributed to it.
                                             While the research to date has reported robust results, little has been performed to
                                       understand terrorism at the sub-state level. It is well understood that the causes of terrorism
                                       at general levels and there are qualitative inferences as to why it occurs within specific
                                       regions, but what is less clear is whether terrorism can be predicted at smaller scales.
                                       Additionally, few studies have focused on remote sensing and spatial sciences.
                                             This research aims to predict terrorism in Europe at the sub-national level. The ob-
                                       jectives of the study are the following: (1) develop a model to predict terrorism using
                                       satellite imagery and socio-environmental data; (2) develop a grid-cell-based spatial statis-
                                       tics approach to reveal specific causal variables and trends in this region at a previously
                                       unexplored spatial scale.

                                       2. Methods
                                            This study includes 18,741 attacks occurring between 1970 and 2018 in Eastern and
                                       Western Europe apart from Russia. The target was developed using the National Consor-
                                       tium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Global Terrorism Database (GTD) [26].
                                       The GTD is an open-source dataset of terrorist incidents since 1970 that has been georefer-
                                       enced, matches the definitional criteria of the study, and has been the primary source of
                                       terrorism studies in the United States.
                                            Remotely sensed data was collected from a variety of sources including the 2000 Shuttle
                                       Radar Topography Mission, 2020 Copernicus land cover [27], and 2018 nighttime lights
                                       from the visible and infrared imaging suite (VIIRS) sensor on board the Joint Polar-orbiting
                                       Satellite System [28]. Figure 1 visualizes the study and samples the remote sensing data
                                       used in the study.

                                             The predictor variables (Table 1) were chosen due to the interaction effect each likely
                                       has on the target variable. Proximity to major roadways provides convenient transportation
                                       to and from the target location while waterways may provide an additional, alternative, or
                                       backup means of escape for well-planned attacks in addition to the well-known geographic
                                       link between cities and bodies of water. Additionally, nighttime lights, population density,
                                       and land cover each track an important aspect of human geography. Naturally, terrorists
                                       are likely to attack urban centers with large numbers of civilians, and most likely, those that
                                       are well-developed. All of which is captured in the three variables. Slope and elevation
                                       were included to capture any geographic and spatial logic consistent among densely
                                       populated urban areas not previously captured; while civil unrest attempts to assess the
                                       public sentiment that may drive a terrorist to select, or not select, a specific location.

                                             To evaluate model predictions, accuracy, average precision (AP), and F-1 scores are
                                       reported. However, due to accuracy’s sensitivity to class imbalances [32], AP and F-1 are
                                       used for final assessment and comparison. Average Precision, ∑ n ( Rn − Rn−1 ) Pn , is
                                       informative of the precision-recall curve, with Rn and Pn being the precision and recall
                                                                            2 ∗ ( P∗ R)
                                       scores at the nth step, while F-1, P+ R , is the harmonic mean of precision and recall
                                       globally [33]. Both metrics are therefore more robust and overcome overly optimistic
                                       metrics by assessing Type 1 and Type 2 errors [34].
                                             Logistic regression classifies input data by maximizing the log odds that an obser-
                                       vation belongs to the nth class. In doing so, it provides intuitive coefficients and class
                                       probabilities allowing for excellent inferential interpretation. Additionally, it has been
                                       shown to perform well in the face of more flexible non-parametric models such as Support
                                       Vector Machines and Neural Networks [35,36]. This model was optimized with stochastic
                                       gradient descent [37], leveraging an alpha value of 1 × 10−6 , and an initial learning rate of
                                       0.1, producing an 0.87 F-1 score.

                                       5. Conclusions
                                            Although this study demonstrated robust results, there remain challenges in the field
                                       and limitations to the study. First, this study created a 25 sq. km hexagonal grid cell
                                       approach to understand where terrorism is likely to occur. However, it did not consider
                                       neighboring pixel values in the rasters from which the features were sampled. It may be
                                       deduced that if an attack occurred in an area deemed agricultural but on the edge of the
                                       pixel nearest urban areas, the attack location was not chosen due to its agricultural nature
                                       but its proximity to urban centers. However, attempts to include this spatial attribute
                                       degraded model performance and limited inference. Additionally, categorical variables
                                       could not be computed in this way as it would result in the loss of the land cover class
                                       entirely and introduce a continuous component to a categorical variable.
                                            To ensure this limitation was not detrimental to the results of the study, multiple
                                       experiments were conducted at different grid-cell sizes (100 and 50 square kilometers),
                                       shapes (square), and random sampling. Across all experiments, results differed marginally,
                                       by approximately 0.06. The method proposed in this study produced the highest results,
                                       but relative model performance remained consistent across all studies, with Random Forest
                                       outperforming every other model. Nonetheless, future research should improve upon this
                                       methodology and include the spatial relationship of nearby pixel values.
                                            Additionally, the features collected for this data contained only a snapshot of the
                                       temporal period covered. For example, it is not believed a terrorist attack in 1970 could
                                       have foreseen the land use of Europe in 2020, and it is unlikely the classification would
                                       have remained across the fifty years. Greater control over the spatial-temporal aspect of
                                       terrorism should be a consideration of future research.
                                            Lastly, despite these studies’ results suggesting traditional classifiers outperform
                                       neural network architectures, there remain significant areas in which deep learning could
                                       improve upon the limitations of this work. This study approached the topic from a vector-
                                       based solution, but the issue could also be applied from a computer vision approach using
                                       convolutional neural networks and key point detection. Research in this area would likely
                                       improve upon the shortcomings of this work.
                                            The Random Forest outperformed more complex models, including multi-layered
                                       neural networks. This is likely due to Random Forest’s robustness in the presence of
                                       multiple issues inherent in anomaly detection studies, of which terrorism is most assuredly
                                       a spatial anomaly. Neural network performance, however, cannot be guaranteed in the
                                       presence of large data imbalances. In fact, class imbalance is perhaps one of the greatest
                                       pitfalls of fully connected networks [48].
                                            However, the model demonstrated false negative spatial correlation and therefore may
                                       not capture all possible attack locations in Eastern Ukraine, Northern Ireland, the island of
                                       Corsica, and the central Balkans or project to those areas subject to separatist terrorism in
                                       the future. In doing so, this study quantitatively backed previous research’s understanding
                                       of the geographic difference between territorial and non-territorial terrorism. Future work
                                       should improve upon this study with respect to the consideration of surrounding pixel
                                       values among the raster data sets.
                                            From this work, we can conclude the following: terrorist target selection is not complex
                                       and can largely be inferred. Additionally, non-separatist terrorism operates with like-
                                       spatial logic but distinct from that of separatists. Parsing the spatial dimension of territorial
                                       terrorism will likely require a unique set of explanatory variables and model selection that
                                       is not captured here.
