Everybody must bring
--------------

* A laptop
* A smartphone with `this Authenticator <https://www.microsoft.com/nb-no/security/mobile-authenticator-app>`_.
* Bank id

Why Cluster?
------------
Driving the largest model locally requires 8 graphics cards where each card costs the equivalent of a nice used car. Since you do not need this model so often, it is better to share the resources than everybody having their own supercomputer.

**How?**

In this workshop we are going to use a supercomputer with the name Fox. Logon to Fox is through Educloud. We are going to learn how to control the creativity of the models. We are going to use an interface with the name of Juypyter Lab because it is easier than running the model from the command prompt. At the same time
it opens the possibilities of using red data and control the parameters of the model. The same method might be used on black data, but in that case a supercomputer with the name of Colossus, would have had to be used. This will not be covered in the workshop.

**10:00-10:15**

* We go strait to the cluster, and order a job :doc:`02_easy_login`. RS demonstration on main screen.
* Short presentation while we are waiting to come into the cluster. Name, role at UiO and what is my relation to AI.
* Presentation working methods with the red and green sticky notes.

**10:15-11:00** 

- Short presentation of the workshop, and its documentation pages 00 - 03 and 05
- Start doing the tasks, while PML and RS check out (green/ red sticky note method) that everybody:
 #. control login with Authenticator and password (10:15 - 10:30)
 #. have set up a my_venv according to the :doc:`01_preparations`
- First task from :doc:`00_motivation`
- Tasks from :doc:`02_easy_login` and :doc:`03_downloading_packages`.
- :doc:`05_hello_world`
- Participants choose the sequence of these tasks themselves.

**11:00-11.10 Break**

**11.10-12:00**

- Confirming that everybody still has a job running on the cluster.
- "AI board" and "Where AIs live" - 10 min talk and room for questions: :doc:`04_ai_board`, :doc:`06_where_ais_live` and :doc:`09_parameters`
- We are starting up a model :doc:`08_pirat`
- Making a prompt and checking the answer. Tasks :doc:`08_pirat`
- Pegasus X Sum. Changing the parameter, and checking the answer Preparations: Read :doc:`09_parameters`. Task: Run the content of the page :doc:`10_pegasus`
- Kobler modellen til dokumenter: :doc:`11_pegasus_continued`
- Logger ut. 
- Kort evaluering: vil jeg være med videre? Skriver navn på grønn lappe om man vil være med i gruppen ut desember 2025
- Skriver navn på rød lapp om man vil slettes fra gruppen.
- Ferdig!

Velkommen, dette blir gøy!
