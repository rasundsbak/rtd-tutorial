At the UiO we have had access to Chat GPT since 2023. In this course we want to teach you what goes on behind the interface. You will learn more on how to start up your own AI from a script in Jupyter Lab.

.. note:: Task 0.1:  Visit UiO `Chat GPT <https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/ki/gpt-uio/>`_ and enter the following: 

Code view::

You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak in whole sentences!
   1) Who are you?
   2) Tell me about your ideal boat?

Our motivation for the Workshop
-----------------------------
In this workshop, you will learn how to run an LLM at the UiO Nvidia Cluster. This is a model which is available from the platform Huggingface. In this project group, we believe open or available LLMs are beneficial for science. This is why we want to learn people how to use them. AIs from Huggingface run on a Transformer architecture. The interactive development environment we are going to use, Jupyter Lab, is an effective way of showing what goes on behind the interface of the AI. You will learn how the functionality of the various language models are put together. You will also learn to set parameters, and how they affect the output. This will give some insight into how the AI of our times work. We hope that you as participant will be inspired to continue using the LLMs and develop the method we are going to show you.
