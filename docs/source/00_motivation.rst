.. index:: chatbot, Chat GPT

At the UiO we have had access to Chat GPT since 2023. In this workshop, we want to teach you what goes on behind the interface. With Chat GPT from UiO you may use up to yellow data, addording to the UiO Data storage guide. In Educloud research, you may store red data, but for black data, you will have to use TSD. TSD has the same infrastructure as Educloud, but the service will not be covered in this workshop. You will learn more on how to start up your own AI from a script in Jupyter Lab, and run it on the Fox NVIDIA Cluster.
