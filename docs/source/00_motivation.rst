Second motivation
-------------------
In order to get a solid documentation for our workshop in January, we need to document how these processes are working for beginners. The reason is that the beginner is installing the packages for the first time. As participants you are contributing in the best way, through making a window of opportunity for us to observe and document how to set up the environment and correct paths in a parsimonious way. We call it "The valuable beginner code".

Why Jupyter lab
---------------
The interactive development environment we are going to use, Jupyter Lab, is an effective way of showing what goes on behind the interface of more expensive or sophisticated AIs. Regarding sophistication, one may also argue that the models we are going to show, have their advantage in the fact that they may be adjusted in a transparent way, by the competent user. You will learn how the functionalities of the various language models are put together. You will also learn to set parameters, and how they affect the output. We hope this will give some insight into how the AI of our times work. We hope that you as participant will be inspired to continue using the LLMs and develop the method we are going to show you, together with us, and in your own research community.

First task
-----------
At the UiO we have had access to Chat GPT since 2023. In this workshop, we want to teach you what goes on behind the interface. You will learn more on how to start up your own AI from a script in Jupyter Lab.

.. note:: Task 0.1. 2 mins.:  Visit UiO `Chat GPT <https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/ki/gpt-uio/>`_ and enter the following:

   You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak in whole sentences!
      1) Who are you?
      2) Tell me about your ideal boat?
