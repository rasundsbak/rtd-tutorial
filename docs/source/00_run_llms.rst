UiO, the Fox and the Nvidia cluster
-----------------------------------
In this documentation, you will learn how to set up an AI process at the UiO Nvidia Cluster. The documentation belongs to a course held as a part of Digital Scholarship Days 2025. The course is for employees at the University of Oslo. If you are in the interest group, you may `sign up here <https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/dsc/2025/digital-scholarship-days/01-run%20large%20language%20models%20through%20Educloud%20UiO>`_. AIs from Huggingface run on a Transformer architecture. The interactive development environment we are going to use, Jupyter Lab, is an effective way of showing what goes on behind the interface of the AI. You will learn how the functionality of the various language models are put together. You will also learn to set parameters, and how they affect the output. This will give some insight into how the AI of our times work.

Learning objectives
-------------------
- Learn how large language models (LLMs) are made
- learn how to use UiOs infrastructure for computational power to use various open LLMs
- Learn how to create effective promts and adjust relevant parameters
- Connect the model to your own data in the form of PDFs og text data.
- Be fluent in how to set up your own model in Jupyter Lab, so that you may use the process independently for interaction with open LLMs
