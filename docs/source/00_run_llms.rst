.. index:: learning objectives


UiO, the Fox and the Nvidia cluster
-----------------------------------
In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up your own virtual environment at the UiO Nvidia Cluster. This documentation is a part of the course held as a part of `Digital Scholarship Days 2025 <https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/dsc/2025/digital-scholarship-days/00-mainpage.html/>`_ The documentation belongs to a course held as a part of Digital Scholarship Days 2025. The course is for employees at the University of Oslo. If you are in the interest group, you may `sign up here <https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/events/dsc/2025/digital-scholarship-days/01-run%20large%20language%20models%20through%20Educloud%20UiO>`_. AIs from Huggingface run on a Transformer architecture. The interactive development environment we are going to use, Jupyter Lab, is an effective way of showing what goes on behind the interface of the AI. You will learn how the functionality of the various language models are put together. You will also learn to set parameters, and how they affect the output. This will give some insight into how the AI of our times work.
