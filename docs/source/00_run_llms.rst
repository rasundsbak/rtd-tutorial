Learning objectives
-------------------
- Learn how large language models (LLMs) are made
- learn how to use UiOs infrastructure for computational power to use various open LLMs
- Learn how to create effective promts and adjust relevant parameters
- Connect the model to your own data in the form of PDFs og text data.
- Be fluent in how to set up your own model in Jupyter Lab, so that you may use the process independently for interaction with open LLMs
