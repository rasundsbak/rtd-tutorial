How to order a job on the Fox
____________________________

When you are logged on to `the Fox <https://ood.educloud.no/>`_, move like this: from the left menu, go to Jupyter lab --> ec443 Choose one of the Nvidia GPUs from the drop down menu --> Rumtime. 1h --> Jupyter variant, Jupyter lab --> (You need not choose jupyter module, as the last version is pre selected) -->  Launch. You are now in the line to get into the Jupyter lab on UiO Fox. You can get tea or coffee, and have a chat with your colleague, while you wait. The waiting time depends on how much you are asking for, when it comes to machine power and time.

.. warning:: 

  Try to get used to experiencing small technical problems like warnings and kernel stops. These are just annoying hickups and usually not problematic.

.. note::

  Task 2.1: Explore the top menu and look into the folders. What does it look like? Familiarize yourself with the browser view of Fox. For a beginner, it is useful to learn how to copy paths and move or copy files and folders between the project area and the Home Directory.

.. note::

  Task 2.2: Look for the left menu in the browser view. Go to Home directory --> Nev directory (White button on second top menu) --> Directory name: documents. This is where you may store the documents for this workshop, and later your own material.


  Task 2.3: Take some, or all of the content from this path: /fp/projects01/ec443/documents, and move it into your own documents folder that you made on your own home directory.
