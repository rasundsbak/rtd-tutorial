Oppstart med JupyterLab
-------------------------

Etter du har logget in, kan du se Educlouds instrumentpanel. Klikk på JupyterLab, for å konfigurere sesjonen.

    I feltet “Choose the Educloud project to run under:”, you should select ec443.

    In the field “Choose resources:”, skal du velge “GPU (1x Nvidia MIG 20G VRAM, 24 CPU cores, 100GB RAM)”.

    In the field “Runtime (in hours)” you should enter 3, for this course. In general, avoid reserving a GPU for longer than necessary, because GPUs are limited, shared resources.

    In the field “Choose Jupyter module (required)” you should select “4.2.0-GCCcore-13.2.0”.

The other fields should be blank. Now, your setup should look like the picture below.

  Task 2.1: Explore the top menu and look into the folders. What does it look like? Familiarize yourself with the browser view of Fox. For a beginner, it is useful to learn how to copy paths and move or copy files and folders between the project area and the Home Directory.

.. note::

  Task 2.2: Look for the left menu in the browser view. Go to Home directory --> New directory (White button on second top menu) --> Directory name: documents. This is where you may store the documents for this workshop, and later your own material.


  Task 2.3: Take some, or all of the content from this path: /fp/projects01/ec443/documents, and move it into your own documents folder that you made on your own home directory.
