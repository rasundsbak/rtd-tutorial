How to order a job on the Fox
____________________________
When you are logged on to `the Fox <https://ood.educloud.no/>`_, move like this: from the left menu, go to Jupyter lab --> ec443 Choose one of the Nvidia GPUs from the drop down menu --> Rumtime. 1h --> Jupyter variant, Jupyter lab --> (You need not choose jupyter module, as the last version is pre selected) -->  Launch. You are now in the line to get into the Jupyter lab on UiO Fox. You can get tea or coffee, and have a chat with your colleague, while you wait. The waiting time depends on how much you are asking for, when it comes to machine power and time.

.. warning:: 

  Try to get used to experiencing small technical problems like the kernel stops. These are just annoying hickups and usually don't make to much problem.

.. note::

  Task 2.1: 2 mins. Look into the folders. What does it look like? Familiarize yourself with the browser view of Fox. For a beginner, this will be useful when you are using the terminal. You can switch back and forth between browser view and terminal/ command prompt, to check if everything is in compliance.

.. note::

  Task 2.2: 2 mins. How do you copy or move files in the terminal view? Hint, mark the file, and click on Move/Copy
