04 Copying and pasting your code into Jupyter lab
=============================================

.. index:: introduction, hello world


In this course, we have tried to make it easy for you, through making the code available. We still have to spend some time familiarizing outselves with copying, pasting and running the code in the cells of Jupyter lab. 


..note::

  Task: Look around in Jupyter lab, and try googling subjects like "jupyter lab cheat sheet", "run cell jupyter lab" and "introduction Jupyter lab".

Code cell 1::

  print('Hello, world.')

You may look `into this tutorial <http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2020_fsri/lessons/l01_welcome.html>`_, in order to become more confident in Jupyter lab. It is advisable that everybody do lesson number 2 "Hello world".
