05 Hello world and how to run cells in Jupyter lab
=============================================

.. index:: introduction, hello world, 


In this course, we have tried to make it easy for you, through making the code available. We still have to spend some time familiarizing outselves with copying, pasting and running the code in the cells of Jupyter lab.


.. note::

  Task 5.1: Look around in Jupyter lab, and try googling subjects like "jupyter lab cheat sheet" and "run cell jupyter lab".

Jupyter lab keyboard shortcuts
---------------------

It is useful for you to look at some `Jupyter lab shortcuts <https://gist.github.com/discdiver/9e00618756d120a8c9fa344ac1c375ac>`_

Hello world
--------------
.. note::

  Task 5.2: Copy the content of the cell below, and run it in Jupyter lab, in an ipynb document.


Code cell 1::

  print('Hello, world.')

.. note::

  Task 5.3: Go to the browser view of Fox. Find the folder "hello_world" on 443. Move it to your Home directory. You will be able to find it in the Jupyter lab that you have launched. Use red sticky note if you need help to find it. Run the cells. Take a minute and reflect on what you did. Study the outputs and cooperate with your sidemate.


.. note::

  Task 5.4: How do we run a cell in Jupyter lab? Try to find shortcut and the menues.
  Task 5.5: How do we stop a cell from running?
  Task 5.6: How do we change the content of a cell from markdown to code, and back again? What is the point with this?
