05 Hello world and how to run cells in Jupyter lab
=============================================

.. index:: introduction, hello world, 


In this course, we have tried to make it easy for you, through making the code available. We still have to spend some time familiarizing outselves with copying, pasting and running the code in the cells of Jupyter lab. 


.. note::

  Task 5.1: Look around in Jupyter lab, and try googling subjects like "jupyter lab cheat sheet", "run cell jupyter lab" and "introduction Jupyter lab".


Hello world
--------------

Code cell 1::

  print('Hello, world.')

You may look `into this tutorial <https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/02-variables.html>`_, in order to become more confident in Jupyter lab. It is advisable that everybody do lesson number 2 "Variables and Assignment".

Jupyter lab keyboard shortcuts
---------------------

It may be useful for you to look at some `Jupyter lab shortcuts <https://gist.github.com/discdiver/9e00618756d120a8c9fa344ac1c375ac>`_

.. note::

  Task 5.2: How do we run a cell in Jupyter lab? Try to find shortcut and the menues.
  Task 5.3: How do we stop a cell from running?
  Task 5.5: How do we change the content of a cell from markdown to code, and back again? What use can that have?
