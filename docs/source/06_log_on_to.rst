We are testing our code with Gnus. See how it jumps!

It is always start with the setwd. It is a good idea to combine it with opening the library(here). Many people prefer to use projects in RStudio. The reason why I no not, is that i feel the setwd command and "here" package gives me both better knowledge and control over my system.



If you do not know your directory, use the command "getwd". Then, copy the directory from the answer you got, and adjust it to fit the path that suits you. In the .R file, at the very begining::

   getwd
   setwd("/Users/ragnhildsundsbak/Documents/LearningR2023/ComtradeProjectNew")

It is always start with the setwd. It is a good idea to combine it with opening the library(here). Many people prefer to use projects in RStudio. The reason why I no not, is that i feel the setwd command and "here" package gives me both better knowledge and control over my system.

In order to follow the process in this script, we need the following pagkages. Note that if you do not have them installed, you must first use the command install.packages("package name"). Since this is to be done only once, I often use the # tag to make the coding turn into a comment that will not be executed.

1 Installation example::
   

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
   Vestibulum quis auctor mi, vel elementum arcu. 
   Donec fermentum luctus rhoncus.

2::

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
   Vestibulum quis auctor mi, vel elementum arcu. 
   Donec fermentum luctus rhoncus.

   Selected output console:

   > 
   > 
   > 



It is also necesary to rule out the conflicts between the packages that are in use 
3::

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
   Vestibulum quis auctor mi, vel elementum arcu. 
   Donec fermentum luctus rhoncus.

4::

   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
   Vestibulum quis auctor mi, vel elementum arcu. 
   Donec fermentum luctus rhoncus.


   Selected output:

We are ready to start the process of getting data.
