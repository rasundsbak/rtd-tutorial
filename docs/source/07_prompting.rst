Turning roles around: Who is asking now?
-------------
Promting an AI can be like making a conversation with an expert. If you know what you are asking for, and provide some context, the AI will answer your questions in the best possible way. For example: "I want to grow vegetables in my garden, but before you answer, make an interview with me so that you can give a best possible answer." The AI may ask how much sunlight there is in your garden". Background information may be essential for the response the AI gives. The AI and you may not have ended on the same conclusion, if you at first had not asked for the interview.

Tips for future prompting
---------------------
In this workshop, you will practice deciding the role of the AI. An economist, a gardener or a pirate. The Llama model is known for having a special ability to adapt to a role. This may be good or bad. In order to get a good output with the Llama model, you have to try to neutralize the ego of the AI. This is done through giving the right formulations of the role in the prompt. In the next chapter, we will experiment with different phrasings to see how the model responds. We will also try limiting the output adjusting the parametres. Many users at UiO have already had a year of experience with prompting the UiO Chat GPT. This is a more advanced AI that can remember the conversation. In your future interactions with various AIs, review outputs critically and refine your prompts iteratively. Use the model's strengths to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler questions, like for instance "what is the best cure of Ibux and Paracetamol, if you have headache?". Use follow up questions. Ask the model to elaborate on something you want to know more about. Contect and information is important in order to make use of the AI.

When the log is too long, the model gets tired
---------------------
It needs to rest. When the conversation is too long, the model might start to seem comfused, or start using a strange language. Ask the model to sum up the conversation. This can be the first prompt in a new dialogue, and you can delete the old dialogue.
