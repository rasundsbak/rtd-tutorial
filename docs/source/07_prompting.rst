Promting guide:
Promting in AI is like talking with an expert. If you know what you want to know, you can be specific, and provide context, examples, and even ask the AI to interview you so that the AI can answer your questions as good as possible. For example: "I want to grow vegetables in my garden, but before you answer, make an interview so that you can give a best possible answer." The AI may ask if it is much sunlight in your garden" and if you say no, then the AI will get some background information that will later be very important for the suggestions the AI give you. The AI and you may not think about this if you first was not asking for the interview.
 
You can choose to decide the AI's role, like an economist, gardener, pirate.
Experiment with different phrasings to see how the model responds.
Try to limit the output with adjusting the parametres, or just write "I want the answer in two sentences".
Review outputs critically and refine your prompts iteratively, because the AI normally remember.
Use the model's strengths to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler questions, like what is the best of Ibux and Paracetamol for headache.
Follow up questions: Ask the model to elaborate something you want to know more about.
Provide context and ask for more information in that context.
