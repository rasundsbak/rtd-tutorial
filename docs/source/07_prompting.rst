Turn roles around:
-------------
Promting in AI can be like making a conversation with an expert. If you know what you are asking for, and provide some context, the AI can answer your questions as good as possible. For example: "I want to grow vegetables in my garden, but before you answer, make an interview with me so that you can give a best possible answer." The AI may ask if it is much sunlight in your garden" and if you say no, then the AI will get some background information that may later be important for the suggestions the AI give you. The AI and you may not have ended with the same conclusion if you first would not have asked for the interview.

Tips for future prompting
---------------------
In this workshop, you can choose to decide the AI's role, like an economist, gardener, pirate. In the next chapter, we will experiment with different phrasings to see how the model responds. We will try to limit the output with adjusting the parametres. Many users at UiO have also had a year of experience with prompting the Chat GPT. This is a more advanced AI that can remember the conversation. In your future interactions with various AIs, review outputs critically and refine your prompts iteratively. Use the model's strengths to handle complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler questions, like for instance "what is the best cure of Ibux and Paracetamol, if you have headache?". Follow up questions: Ask the model to elaborate on something you want to know more about. Provide context and ask for more information in that context.
