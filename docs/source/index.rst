In this project, We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ to formulate our ideas.

Run large language models (LLM) through Educloud UiO
===========================================

What is AI and what is an LLM?
------------------------------
AI is a term that is meant to denote what is happening, when a computer do things that require intelligence when done by people (Heaven 2024). In this workshop we are going to work with LLMs. 

   A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of data — hence the name "large." LLMs are built on machine learning: specifically, a type of neural network called a transformer model. (Cloudflare 2024)


At the UiO we have had access to Chat GPT since 2023. In this course we want to teach you what goes on behind the interface. You will learn more on how to start up your own AI from a Script in Jupyter Lab.

.. todo:: 0.1 lage referanseliste. Gå gjennom alle sider og samle alt av referanser eller "further reading" til referanselisten 29_references. Detsom referansen ikke står fra tekst, sett den under egen overskrift: "Further reading". Tekstreferanser settes under "References". Bruk overskrift 2 på begge som er med "-----" under.
.. note:: Task 0.1:  Visit UiO `Chat GPT <https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/ki/gpt-uio/>`_ and enter the following:
