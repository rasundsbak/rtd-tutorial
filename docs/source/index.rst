In this project, We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ to formulate our ideas.

Run large language models (LLM) through Educloud UiO
===========================================

What is AI and what is an LLM?
------------------------------
AI is a term that is meant to denote what is happening, when a computer do things that require intelligence when done by people (Heaven 2024). In this workshop we are going to work with LLMs. 

   A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of data â€” hence the name "large." LLMs are built on machine learning: specifically, a type of neural network called a transformer model. (Cloudflare 2024)


At the UiO we have had access to Chat GPT since 2023. In this course we want to teach you what goes on behind the interface. You will learn more on how to start up your own AI from a Script in Jupyter Lab.

**In this course we will go from 0 to 100 in two days**
You will come out of our classroom fluent in how to set up, prompt, use parameters and regulate the creativity of the language model. This process of using open or available LLModels from Huggingface is not commercial and might have the potential to bringing science forward with greater speed than what we have seen before.
