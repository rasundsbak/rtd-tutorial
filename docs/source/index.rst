Who are we inviting
----------------------
This documentation is a part of the course held at The University og Oslo Library. The course is for employees at the University of Oslo who has some experience with Jupyter. We invite Researchers, PhDs and Postdocs. If you are in the interest group, you may `sign up here <https://nettskjema.no/a/465610>`_. 

.. todo:: 0.1 Takke nettverket ett eller annet sted.

Prior Knowledge
-----------------
You should have attended the course "Plotting and Programming in Python" held as a Carpentry program at the `Digital Scholarship Centre <https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/>`_, or have a similar degree of knowledge to Python and JupyterLab. You may take `The lesson <https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/>`_, as a self study.

Learning objectives
----------------------
- Learn how large language models (LLMs) are used
- learn how to use UiOs infrastructure for computational power to use various open LLMs
- Learn how to create effective prompts and adjust relevant parameters
- Connect the model to your own data in the form of PDFs or text data.
- Be fluent in how to set up your own model in Jupyter Lab, so that you may use the process independently for interaction with other open LLMs
